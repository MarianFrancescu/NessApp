<!--
    here are tasks 7 and 8. I created the nested components
        put them in parent html code. 
    For passing the property name I used a @Input decorator in
        first-class.component.ts named item.
-->
<p>parent works!</p>
<first-child [item]="name"></first-child>
<second-child></second-child>
